You just created your first vector! Now, let’s first enter a vector with more than one number. E.g. a vector containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, in that order. If you enter these numbers just like this, R will respond with an error message. It throws an error, because it needs a little bit more information from our side that we actually want to store those numbers in a vector structure.
